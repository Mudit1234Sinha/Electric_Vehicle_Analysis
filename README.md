# Electric_Vehicle_Analysis
I have done the Electric vehicle market segmentation analysis using Machine learning tools like SkLearn, Pandas, Numpy

I have created various visualization plots using scatterplot and barplot to gather the relationships between different columns and to draw inference regarding that

Finally I have used Clustering Analysis and K-Means clustering for the final analysis
